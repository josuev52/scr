<p> CIS 7 COURSE PROJECT
<br>BY GAMBLE INC. (Emiliano Melendrez, Nathan Berry, Josue Vides)
<br> DECEMBER 2024
<br> CASE 4: CASINO BLACK-JACK
  <br> Instructions: When you run the program, if you have not hit 21, program will ask whether you would like to hit or stand, enter y to hit, enter n to stand
  <br> If you are dealt an ace, you have the choice to either make equal to 1 or 11, by entering the value
  <br> Programming Approach: We used functions in order to deal player and dealer hands, and used rand and srand to assign randon cards to player
  <br> Furthermore, we used logic gates in order to allow player to choose ace value, and give appropriate answer
